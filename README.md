This era has to digitize education by most of the students lags behind as either they have low internet or no internet connection. we try to overcome that problem.
Live classes at low or 2G internet/ Dial incall:-
Pandemic forces our education system to completely rely on the Internet. But due to
this many students and teachers are lagging behind because of low internet
connection or no internet connection. The people living in J&K, get only 2G internet
Connection but the software like Microsoft teams and Google Meet demands very
good internet speed. In fact, the data consumption by these apps is also a major
concern for most students.
We try to solve this problem in an innovative and interactive manner. We will be
making a web-App where only the voices of students and teachers are connected
using Voice over the internet, VoIP and instead of sharing the screen or watching the
teacher, we will be synchronizing the voice and video generated by the voice of the
teacher.
This can be done by making an interactive doodle video that helps the teacher to
draw more attention from students.
As the data speed required for a good internet voice call is 64kbps and average data
distributed in India is 8.1 Mbps so this not only solves the low internet
speed but also reduces the data consumption by the classes.
